# junior_dev_CV

This is a CV template based on 'developer CV' template by Jan Vorisek. 

The template has a kinda retro look, but it's also flexible. Color pallette is easily changable in the preamble 
of main_template.tex document. Any parameters of \tcolorbox which is a main building block for this document 
can be easily changed (for reference see tcolorbox manual here: http://www.texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/tcolorbox/tcolorbox.pdf)

The .tex document as well as .cls file are well documented, in case of questions you can message me on 
cinna.monovic@gmail.com

Hope you like it and that it may aid you in communicating your skills clearly to your potential employer.
